# Investment Portfolio Optimization

## Description
This project optimizes stock and bond allocations using **Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)** and **Monte Carlo Simulations**. It includes a **Market Analyzer** that evaluates different market scenarios to enhance risk assessment and decision-making. The optimization process ensures an efficient risk-return trade-off, while financial reporting and visualizations provide insights into portfolio performance before and after optimization.
